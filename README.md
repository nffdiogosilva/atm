# ATM

This was a group project made in an Introduction to Programming class, for simulating an atm behavior.

This was my first project using the Java language. I didn't made any changes nor have i looked to the code for years (this was made in 2010).

The many purpose is to display this to the world.

## The Project

This project simulates an ATM behavior with a Command Line Interface (CLI).

The data persistence is made in objects files. The clients data is readable on the file clientes.txt.
All of the menu output is in portuguese. You can read the projects requirements in the report.pdf file, on the resources folder.
